# **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model Deployment using Streamlit**

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project focuses on building and deploying an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model** using **Streamlit**. The model is trained to predict customer churn based on various factors such as demographics, account details, and service usage.

## **🎯 Objectives**
✔ Develop an ANN model to classify customer churn.
✔ Preprocess and analyze customer data.
✔ Deploy an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.
✔ Allow users to input new customer data and receive real-time predictions.

---

## **📂 Dataset Overview**
### **🔹 Data Source**
The dataset used is `anndataset.csv`, which contains customer information with multiple features.

### **🔹 Features and Target Variable**
- **📊 Independent Variables (Features):**
  - `SeniorCitizen`, `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`
  - `gender`, `Partner`, `Dependents`, `PhoneService`, `MultipleLines`
  - `InternetService`, `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, `DeviceProtection`
  - `TechSupport`, `StreamingTV`, `StreamingMovies`, `Contract`
  - `PaperlessBilling`, `PaymentMethod`
- **🎯 Dependent Variable (Target):**
  - `Churn` (Binary: 1 = Yes, 0 = No)

---

## **🛠 Methodology**
### **🔹 Data Preprocessing**
✔ **Handling Missing Values:** Imputed missing values for numerical features.
✔ **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Applied Label Encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical form.
✔ **Feature Scaling:** Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
✔ **Train-Test Split:** Split data into **training (80%)** and **validation (20%)** sets.

### **🔹 Model Architecture**
- **Input Layer:** Accepts numerical features.
- **Hidden Layers:** Two fully connected layers with ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer:** Uses sigmoid activation for binary classification.

## **💻 Implementation**
### **🔹 Technologies Used**
✅ **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit  
✅ **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda, Streamlit Cloud

### **🔹 Model Training**
```python
model.add(Dense(19, input_shape=(19,), activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
```
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Evaluation Metric:** Accuracy

### **🔹 Deployment Using Streamlit**
✔ Built an interactive dashboard allowing users to input values and receive churn predictions.  
✔ Hosted the app on **Streamlit Community Cloud**.  
✔ Used `requirements.txt` to manage dependencies.  

---

## **📈 Results & Evaluation**
📌 **Training Accuracy:** 92%  
📌 **Validation Accuracy:** 88%  

### **🔹 Key Findings**
✅ Customers with **longer tenure** and **lower monthly charges** are less likely to churn.  
✅ **Contract type** and **payment method** significantly impact churn probability.  
✅ Users with **no tech support and online security** have a higher chance of leaving.  
✅ Monthly charges have a **strong correlation** with churn behavior.

---

## **🔎 Insights & Observations**
📌 **High-risk customers** are those who have **month-to-month contracts** and use **paperless billing**.  
📌 **Loyal customers** generally have **long-term contracts** and **low monthly fees**.  
📌 **Providing better tech support and security features** could reduce churn rates significantly.  
📌 Introducing **discounts or incentives for long-term contracts** might improve customer retention.  

---

## **🚀 Deployment Guide**
### **🔹 Running Locally**
```bash
streamlit run ann.py
```

### **🔹 Deploying on Streamlit Cloud**
1. Push code to GitHub.
2. Connect GitHub repo to Streamlit Cloud.
3. Select `ann.py` as the entry point and deploy.

---

## **📌 Conclusion & Future Scope**
### **🔹 Conclusion**
✔ Successfully built and deployed an ANN-based churn prediction model.  
✔ Streamlit provides an intuitive interface for real-time predictions.  
✔ Key customer insights can be leveraged to reduce churn rates.

### **🔹 Future Scope**
✅ Enhance the model with additional feature engineering.  
✅ Deploy the model as a web API for broader accessibility.  
✅ Optimize model hyperparameters using Grid Search.  
✅ Implement real-time customer retention strategies based on predictions.
